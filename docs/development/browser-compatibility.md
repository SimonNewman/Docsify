# Browser Compatibility

All website development should be compatible on the following mainstream browsers that are still supported by their vendors.

Any development targeted at unsupported browsers may be subject to additional costs.

## Apple Safari

Safari’s support only extends to macOS operating systems from version 10.11 (El Capitan) and above. Support for the Windows version ended in 2012.

## Google Chrome

Google doesn’t publish end of life dates for its products, however, because it doesn’t allow users to download previous versions, that only the current, stable release is supported.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE)

As of the 12th of January 2016, Microsoft only supports Internet Explorer (IE) 11. IE11 does not currently have its own end of life date so it is assumed that as it is aligned with Windows 10, whose extended support ends on the 14th of October 2025.

## Mozilla Firefox

In a similar fashion to Google Chrome, Firefox doesn’t offer previous versions for download so the current stable, release is the supported browser. However, Mozilla do offer an Extended Support Release (ESR) “for system administrators who deploy and maintain the desktop environment in organizations such as universities and other schools, county or city governments and businesses“. As of writing the current ESR version is in the 52.x.x version series.

## Opera

As per Google Chrome, Opera only supports the latest, stable update.
